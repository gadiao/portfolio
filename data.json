The lands around the proposed Wind Farms are used for agriculture or open green spaces.",

The device cannot penetrate further than the area the device is designed to image. The Aerial LiDAR data was able to capture accurate vertical measurements but not granular enough to image the building from above.",

This is first done by taking SAR satellite data and then using VV (Vertical Vertical Polarization) and VH (Vertical Horizontal Polarization) images from the subset of 2017 and 2018 images. For the RGB images on the bottom, Red represents the division of the year 2017 and 2018 for the relevant band, Green represents the year 2017 for the band, and Blue represents the year 2018 for the band. By doing this, the green and blue pixels together fill in the non-relevant features that do not cover forest cover change while the red pixels will show which areas that have little to no forest cover as its values are flipped as seen on the table above where bright areas for the divided bands are flipped making it the ideal band to show tree cover. The polarization for VV is the most useful for identifying forest cover as it covers a higher count of red pixels where areas of no forests are seen.",

LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) is a part of neural network that is adept with time-series data.  A Convolution model makes predictions based on a fixed-width history and is able to see how things are changing over time by using convolutions and filters to output a specified value. Mean Absolute Percentage Error is a statistic used to measure the quality of a model’s predictions and measures the average difference between the actual and the predicted values. Both the LSTM and CNN has performed quite well compared to the CCYF, though more studies will be required because of the obstacles encountered in implementations. Some evidence of overfitting has been found in all the models, especially the canola crop yield prediction. The machine learning models have potential to replace the traditional model in crop yield prediction.",

In terms of aesthetics, it differs from a traditional hotspot analysis because it the hotspot calculations were grouped together using a fishnet from a given shapefile and in this case it is the OSD files for the province of Ontario. To have better look, OLS and GWR calculations were used. Multivariate OLS and GWR have different representations in showing explanatory variables to help predict where future stores will be located. With both a high R-squared obtained from the OLS and GWR, we can prove that Home Depot stores are strategically placed in high populated with well-endowed individuals who can afford the tools and equipment in the store. More than likely, more stores will be built alongside the development of the suburbs of expanding cities like Toronto and Ottawa.",

Looking at Figure 2, PC1 and latitude is seen to have a slight positive correlation with significant uniformity in the distribution of points. PC2 has a very slight negative correlation with longitude as seen from its significant uniformity while PC3 has a slight positive correlation with somewhat significant uniformity with longitude.",
